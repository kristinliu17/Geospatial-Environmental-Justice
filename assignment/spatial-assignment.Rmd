## Learning objectives
This module provides an introduction to the fundamentals of working with spatial vector and raster data in R while empirically exploring why systematic and structural racism is interwined with urban ecological processes. This module uses the Simple Features Access standard (ISO 19125) and tidyverse-style workflow using the sf package and emerging ecosystem of r-spatial tools.

# Exercise 
In August 2020, [Christopher Schell](http://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/cjschell) and collegues published a review in *Science* on ['The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments'](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/12/science.aay4497) (DOI: 10.1126/science.aay4497), showing how systematic racism and classism  has significant impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes within urban environments. Here we explore a subset of the data used to support these findings in this review and the broader literature.

The [press release](https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/08/13/systemic-racism-has-consequences-for-all-life-in-cities/) on the paper is worth a read:

> “Racism is destroying our planet, and how we treat each other is essentially structural violence against our natural world,” said lead author Christopher Schell, an assistant professor of urban ecology at the University of Washington Tacoma. “Rather than just changing the conversation about how we treat each other, this paper will hopefully change the conversation about how we treat the natural world.”

In the paper, Schell writes: 

 > "In multiple cases, neighborhood racial composition can be a stronger predictor of urban socio-ecological patterns than wealth."

We are going to explore one metric for how structural racism and classism underpin landscape heterogeneity in cities.

**Figure 2** in the Schell paper shows how NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) tracks historical redlining.
![Fig. 1.](figures/fig2.png)

We are going to recreate these city maps, and plot the distributions and mean vegetation patterns across cities to explore the structural inequality and racism that Schell et al highlight in their paper.

To do this we are going to use the following spatial data:  

**1.Mapping Inequality:** (vector data)  
[here](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=3/41.245/-105.469&text=intro)

> "As you explore the materials Mapping Inequality, you will quickly encounter exactly that kind of language, descriptions of the "infiltration" of what were quite often described as "subversive," "undesirable," "inharmonious," or "lower grade" populations, for they are everywhere in the HOLC archive ....These grades were a tool for redlining: making it difficult or impossible for people in certain areas to access mortgage financing and thus become homeowners. Redlining directed both public and private capital to native-born white families and away from African American and immigrant families. As homeownership was arguably the most significant means of intergenerational wealth building in the United States in the twentieth century, these redlining practices from eight decades ago had long-term effects in creating wealth inequalities that we still see today. Mapping Inequality, we hope, will allow and encourage you to grapple with this history of government policies contributing to inequality."

**2.Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** (raster data)
NDVI is used as proxy measure of vegetation health, cover and phenology (life cycle stage) over large areas. It is calculated using multiple bands from satellite images.

##### We first install all the necessary libraries that will allow us to visualize raster and vector data formats. We then created a folder for the shapefiles of the cities we wish to analyze and downloaded the shape files for each city.
```{r setup, include= FALSE}
# install.packages(c("tmap", "raster", "sf"))
library(tmap)      #interactive maps, raster + vector layers
library(sf)          # to work with simple features (vector) data
library(tidyverse)   # our old friend
library(terra)       # Successor to the raster library
```  

```{r}
dir.create("../data/shapefiles")

              "../data/shapefiles/ALBirmingham1937.zip")

              "../data/shapefiles/INIndianapolis1937.zip")

unzip("../data/shapefiles/ALBirmingham1937.zip",
      exdir = "../data/shapefiles/birmingham")
unzip("../data/shapefiles/AZPhoenix19XX.zip", 
      exdir = "../data/shapefiles/phoenix")
unzip("../data/shapefiles/CASanFrancisco1937.zip", 
      exdir = "../data/shapefiles/sf")
unzip("../data/shapefiles/INIndianapolis1937.zip", 
      exdir = "../data/shapefiles/indianapolis")
```

##### Using the downloaded shapefiles, we created maps of Birmingham, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Indianapolis that show current (2019) mean NDVI across city redlining from the 1950s. NDVI stands for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which assesses vegetation and its condition in an area by using bands of remote sensing data. After reading in and rasterizing the NDVI data for each city, we created graphs using the tmap package and overlaid the HOLC grades for each corresponding city. HOLC grade refers to assigned grades that reflect the "mortgage security" of each neighborhood in the city; neighborhoods that received the highest grade of "A" were deemed as safe investments and posed minimal risks for banks and mortgage lenders, while neighborhoods that received the lowest grade of "D" were considered hazardous.
##### When looking at each of the following four maps, we noticed that areas with higher HOLC grades, such as "A" and "B", tend to have higher mean NDVI values. We observed higher concentrations and darker pixels in blue and yellow outlined neighborhoods of each city, which corresponds with healthier and more abundant vegetation.

indianapolis_vec <- indianapolis %>% mutate(area = st_area(geometry))
```

##### Through utilizing the terra library, we created new vectors for each city that contain the average NDVI values for every neighborhood. Using these new vectors, we plotted the average NDVI values in different neighborhoods as well as the distribution of pixel values across cities and neighborhoods. 
##### We observe that in all 4 cities, mean NDVI tends to be lower in neighborhoods with lower HOLC grades. The values plotted on top of blue and yellow outlined neighborhoods are higher than those of purple and red outlined neighborhoods. This is further confirmed in the tables we make that find the mean NDVI values for each HOLC grade of the four cities. As we move from higher to lower HOLC grade neighborhoods, there is a decrease in NDVI value and vegetation cover.

##### When taking a closer look at specific neighborhoods of different holc grades, there is noticeable difference in NDVI values. In Birmingham, the lighter-colored and less condensed pixels of this "D" grade, redlined neighborhood suggests that there is less vegetation cover and a lower NDVI average. When we compare this section of Birmingham to a HOLC grade A neighborhood, we observe higher saturation and density of pixels and an average NDVI of 0.808. This is much more vegetation cover than the lower grade neighborhood, which has an average NDVI of 0.354. Plotting these averages and comparing them to each other shows the structural inequality and racism that many cities, not just Birmingham, face in terms of urban ecology and wealth.
```{r}
gradeA_bb <- st_bbox(combined_birmingham %>% filter(holc_id %in% c("A1")))
tm_shape(birmingham_ndvi, bbox = gradeA_bb) + tm_raster() + tm_shape(combined_birmingham) + 
  tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha = 0.4) + tm_text("NDVI", size = 0.9) + 
  tm_layout(title = "Birmingham Close-Up", legend.outside = TRUE) 

gradeD_bb <- st_bbox(combined_birmingham %>% filter(holc_id %in% c("D5")))
tm_shape(birmingham_ndvi, bbox = gradeD_bb) + tm_raster() + tm_shape(combined_birmingham) + 
  tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha = 0.4) + tm_text("NDVI", size = 0.9) + 
  tm_layout(title = "Birmingham Close-Up", legend.outside = TRUE) 
```

##### After plotting NDVI values and redlining for multiple cities, we can consider how systemic inequity and racism are important in the context of global change and developing solutions to the biodiversity crisis. We can see that urban ecology has vast impacts; if we look at the NDVI maps versus the redlining in cities you can see the impacts of redlining on vegetation levels. There is a clear lack of vegetation in poorer, predominantly Black redlined neighborhoods versus their wealthier, white counterparts. For example looking at Phoenix, Arizona, NDVI levels in redlined neighborhoods are significantly lower than in the blue "A" non-redlined neighborhoods.
